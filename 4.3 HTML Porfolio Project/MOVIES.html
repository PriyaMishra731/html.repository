<p>This is my favourite movie and i love watching it repeatedly.
<P> When i watched this movie for the very first time i just immediately fell in love with the character.</P>
<p> I just relate to this character a lot and can understand the way she feels.</p>
</p>
<h3> AMERICAN PSYCHO</h3>

<p>I really like this movie a lot! Whenever i feel little low i just</p>
<p> go back to this movie for motivation. i love how he is a perfectionist and cannot bear anyone else being perfect in the room rather than him. </p>
<p> He is always fit and always takes care of himself very well which i love the most.</p>
